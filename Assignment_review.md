# Assignment 1 Review

I am afraid for my grade.

There were no real specifications for this besides make the introduction two paragraphs and have FAQs. I completed the requirements, but having so few requirements makes me nervous. I really wasn't sure how to complete this assignment, but I think I did. If you grade off those requirements only, then I got an A+! Woohoo! But I probably didn't. Also,The amount of time you gave us to write the assignment stressed me out. Less than a week from getting my topic approved to me handing in the completed article was, for lack of a better term, stressfull. The topic was easy, because I have shown chickens for 12 years, but turning that knowledge into basically an unknown document is kinda scary. I did really like being able to choose what I can write about and to be creative.

Review of Github

I still don't really like Github. For me, it's difficult to see the words on the screen. It's easier to see them in other things like Microsoft Word, because the font is bolder and it doesn't make my head hurt. The letters are too small, thin and faint for me to see them clearly as I type into Github. The formatting that you said would be easier than Microsoft Word really isn't. There is a whole new code to learn, and I stress over not knowing how it will turn out as soon as I do something. I have been raised using Word, and that is where I am most comfortable.
