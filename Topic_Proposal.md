# Topic Proposal

I would like to do my instructional essay over the topic of how to show a chicken. I will use one breed of bird and go over the steps of properly choosing the right bird according to the standards in the APA Standard of Perfection. I will discuss possible disqualifications and defects to avoid, and also how to prepare the bird for the show including bathing and grooming. 

If this subject is too broad, I can shorten it to preparing a bird for show, going over bathing, grooming, and specific tips and tricks.
