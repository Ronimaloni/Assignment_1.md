# How to Choose Your Best Show Winning Chickens
*By Erin Ingalsbe*

## Introduction

The first poultry show began in 1845 in London. The domestication and promotion of showing chickens came about because of the banning of cockfighting. Ever since the first poultry shows, Breeders have groomed and selected for certain traits that coincide with their breed. These breeds were streamlined with the creation of the Standard of Perfection in 1865. Chickens became increasingly popular, moving to America in 1849. Showing poultry even reached the royal courts of England, where Queen Victoria raised Cochins for poultry shows. Eventually the American Poultry Association took over many poultry shows and made the industry as we know it today. 

Poultry is so diversible from the commercial poultry plants supplying eggs and meat for the world, down to the backyard hobbyist. Everyone is connected to poultry in some way and can find joy from being a part of it. This article serves as a guide for beginner poultry enthusiasts, backyard hobbyists, and Level 1 4-H Poultry members. This guide will aid in the process of choosing the right bird to show based on its physical traits and how to groom that show-winning bird to perform its best in a poultry show. 
 

## Choosing the best chicken

Before you can begin culling down to your show-winner, you must choose a breed of chicken that you like. The breed you choose must be admitted into the American Poultry Association’s Standard of Perfection. This book creates a standard for each accepted breed to follow. Breeders and showmen alike aspire to recreate the “perfect bird” described in the Standard of Perfection. The Standard will give specific things to look for such as:

* Weight
* Feather color 
* Eye color
* Feet and leg color
* Body shape
* Comb type and size
* Disqualifications

Before selecting certain traits, you must distinguish whether you have standard or bantam chickens. Standards are much bigger than bantam chickens. Many times, one breed will have both standards and bantams, making bantams like the toy version of a dog. It is very important to check the size of your bantams because they can get too big and be disqualified. Standard sized birds are the opposite, they will never be too big, but they could be too small to compete in the show. This is why it is important to know what your breed is supposed to weigh. After choosing your breed, you must evaluate each bird and pick the one you would like to show based on how closely they resemble the “perfect bird” in the Standard of Perfection. Some breeds have intricate color patterns or variations that must be evaluated while others have one simple color like black or white. Next, look at their eyes and make sure the color matches what the Standard says. Some could be yellow or reddish-brown. After evaluating their eye color, move on to their feet and legs. Chickens may have yellow, white, blue, or even black feet and legs. The Standard will dictate what color legs your bird should have. Body shape typically indicates the body shape of the bird. Many will have a rectangular shape while others should have so many feathers they will look like a butterball. Disqualifications to avoid include split tail, wry tail, split wing, and side sprigs on their comb.

 ## Grooming a Show Winner
 
 ### Bathing
 
 After choosing the bird you want to show, you will need to clean and groom it. About two weeks before the show, the bird will need a bath. 
 
 Some Equipment you will need to wash a chicken:
 * Three five-gallon buckets
 * Dish soap
 * Warm Water
 * Bath Towel
 
 To accomplish this, you will need three buckets of warm water large enough to submerge the chicken’s body. In the first bucket, use dish soap to wash the chicken. Lift the wings and scrub the feathers to remove all the dirt. When holding the bird, place each hand on either side of its body, keeping its wings down against its body so it remains calm and won't get away from you. After scrubbing with soap, lift the bird out of the water. Let the water drip off it before placing it into the second bucket. These next two buckets will contain clean, warm water to rinse all the soap out of the bird’s feathers. Repeat the process of lifting the bird out the bucket, letting it drip, and placing it into the next bucket. In each bucket gently push the bird down into the water until the water covers its back. Do not let the chicken’s head be submerged under the water at any time. While holding the chicken under the water, move it around, swishing it through the water and even twisting it back and forth to aid in rinsing all the soap out. Once the chicken has been thoroughly rinsed, take a bath towel, and lay it out on a table. Place the bird on its side, its head sticking off the towel on the longest edge. While holding the bird’s wings down, take one edge of the towel and wrap it over the bird and tuck it under. Then take the other side and wrap it tightly across the chicken’s body opposite direction, making a chicken burrito. This keeps both the wings and the legs wrapped tightly inside the towel so the chicken will not be able to get away. The burrito allows the bird to sit and dry before you let him out.

 While the chicken is still wrapped up, you can trim his beak and toenails if they are too long. Take regular nail clippers and trim the tip of the nail, then trim the edges, rounding off the toe nail to make it less sharp and more natural looking.The same can be done for the top part of the chicken's beak. Be sure not to trim to far or you will cut their quick and they will begin to bleed a little bit. After the chicken’s feathers have completely dried, take baby powder and powder the chicken’s vent (backside or the chicken's butt). This prevents manure from caking up and collecting on the feathers around the vent, making a mess. 
 
 ### Show Day Prep 
 
 On the day of the show, right before judging starts, you will need to clean the bird again. Check the bottoms of his feet for manure and clean them with a baby wipe or an old toothbrush and soap. Take a baby wipe and wipe down the chicken’s feathers, removing dust and giving them a healthy-looking shine. Next, use olive oil and rub it into the comb, face, wattles, beak, legs, feet, and toes. This will bring out the natural color and shine in the bird’s skin and make it look especially healthy. Check the bird one last time for dirt and then place them in their cage to be judged.
